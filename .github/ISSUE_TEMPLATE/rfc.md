## Summary

A brief one-paragraph explanation of the proposal.

## Motivation

Why are we doing this? What problem does it solve? What use cases does it support?

## Detailed Design

Explain the design in enough detail for someone familiar with ASH to understand and implement it. Include:

- How it works
- Any new concepts or terminology
- How it interacts with existing features

## Security Analysis

**This section is required for all RFCs.**

- How does this affect the security model?
- What are the potential attack vectors?
- Does it maintain the core security principles (OTP-only, no key escrow, untrusted relay)?

## Drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this? Consider:
- Implementation cost
- Complexity added
- Security trade-offs

## Alternatives

What other designs have been considered? Why is this approach better?

## Unresolved Questions

What parts of the design are still TBD or need more discussion?

## Implementation Plan

If this RFC is accepted, what's the rough implementation plan?

1. Step one
2. Step two
3. ...
