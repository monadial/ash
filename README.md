# ASH

Secure, ephemeral messaging for high-security, low-frequency communication.

## What is ASH?

ASH is a messaging application that uses One-Time Pad (OTP) encryption to provide information-theoretic security. It is designed for situations where confidentiality matters and trust in infrastructure is limited.

ASH prioritizes:
- Correctness over convenience
- Human-verifiable security
- Minimal trust in infrastructure
- Deliberate user actions

ASH is **not** designed for everyday chat.

## How it works

1. **Ceremony**: Two devices establish a shared One-Time Pad through an offline, QR-based transfer
2. **Verification**: Users confirm matching mnemonic checksums
3. **Messaging**: Messages are encrypted with OTP and relayed through an untrusted backend
4. **Burn**: Either party can irreversibly destroy the conversation

## Architecture

```
┌────────────┐
│   Users    │
└─────┬──────┘
      │
┌─────▼──────┐
│  iOS App   │  (SwiftUI)
└─────┬──────┘
      │  FFI boundary
┌─────▼──────┐
│   core     │  (Shared Rust Core)
└─────┬──────┘
      │
┌─────▼──────┐
│  Backend   │  (Rust Relay)
└────────────┘
```

- **core**: Rust library containing all cryptographic logic
- **apps/ios**: SwiftUI iOS application
- **backend**: Untrusted relay that never sees plaintext

Note: Android support is planned for future versions.

## Security Model

ASH provides:
- Message confidentiality against network and backend observers
- Information-theoretic security via One-Time Pad
- Pad non-reuse enforcement by design
- Human-verifiable ceremony correctness

ASH does **not** provide:
- Anonymity at the network level
- Protection against device compromise
- Protection against malicious participants
- Forensic-level secure deletion
