## Description (4000 characters max)

ASH is a messaging app built for conversations that matter most — the ones that deserve real privacy.

Unlike other "secure" messengers that store your keys on servers or rely on complex protocols, ASH uses a fundamentally different approach: you and your contact meet in person to create a shared secret. No servers involved. No keys transmitted over the internet. Ever.

**How it works:**

1. Meet your contact in person
2. Scan each other's QR codes to exchange encryption keys
3. Verify the connection with a spoken passphrase
4. Message securely from anywhere

**Unbreakable by design**

ASH uses One-Time Pad encryption — the only encryption method mathematically proven to be unbreakable. Each message consumes part of your shared key, which is then permanently destroyed. No amount of computing power can decrypt your messages.

**Ephemeral by default**

Messages don't just disappear from your screen — the encryption keys used to create them are zeroed and gone forever. When you burn a conversation, nothing remains. Not on your device, not on any server.

**Minimal infrastructure**

The relay server only sees encrypted blobs. It cannot read your messages, identify you, or store anything meaningful. Even if compromised, an attacker gains nothing.

**No accounts. No phone numbers. No metadata.**

- No registration required
- No contact list uploads
- No phone number or email needed
- No message history stored anywhere
- No read receipts or typing indicators transmitted

**Features:**

• One-Time Pad encryption (information-theoretic security)
• In-person key ceremony with QR codes
• Verbal passphrase verification
• Disappearing messages with customizable timers
• Burn conversation — destroys all keys and messages instantly
• Location sharing (one-time, precise coordinates)
• Works offline for reading cached messages
• No cloud backup (by design)
• Pad usage indicator shows remaining secure capacity

**Who is ASH for?**

ASH is for people who understand that true security requires intention. It's not for casual chat — it's for conversations where privacy isn't optional.

Journalists protecting sources. Activists in sensitive regions. Professionals discussing confidential matters. Anyone who needs communication that leaves no trace.

**Limitations (by design):**

- Requires in-person meeting to establish each conversation
- Limited message capacity (determined by key size exchanged)
- No group chats (two participants only)
- No media files (text and location only)
- Cannot recover deleted conversations

These aren't missing features — they're deliberate choices that make ASH secure.

**Open approach**

ASH's security doesn't rely on secrets. The cryptographic design is documented and auditable. Security through transparency, not obscurity.
