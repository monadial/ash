# ASH — Ethical Use Statement

This document describes the **ethical position** of the ASH project.

Its purpose is to:
- clearly state intent
- acknowledge risks and misuse potential
- set boundaries for development decisions
- communicate responsibility to users and contributors

ASH is a technical project, but it exists in a social and moral context.

---

## Intent

ASH is designed to help individuals communicate **securely and deliberately** in situations where confidentiality matters and trust in infrastructure is limited.

Examples include:
- sensitive personal conversations
- journalistic source protection
- whistleblowing with trusted parties
- human rights work
- personal safety scenarios

ASH is **not** designed for casual or mass communication.

---

## Acknowledgment of misuse potential

We acknowledge that **any strong privacy or security tool can be misused**.

Potential misuse includes, but is not limited to:
- coordination of criminal activity
- harassment or abuse
- concealment of harmful behavior

These risks are real and must be stated explicitly.

---

## Ethical boundaries of the project

ASH deliberately sets boundaries to **reduce misuse and harm**:

- No anonymity guarantees at the network level
- No mass communication features
- No group chats
- No broadcast channels
- No automation or background syncing
- No stealth or hidden operation modes
- No plausible deniability guarantees

ASH favors **deliberate, visible, human-driven interaction** over convenience or scale.

---

## Responsibility model

ASH operates under the following responsibility model:

- The project authors are responsible for:
  - honest documentation
  - accurate security claims
  - clear communication of limitations
  - refusing features that increase harm

- Users are responsible for:
  - lawful and ethical use
  - understanding the tool’s limitations
  - the behavior of conversation participants

ASH does not claim to prevent misuse by malicious participants.

---

## Design choices driven by ethics

Several design decisions in ASH are motivated explicitly by ethical considerations:

- **Manual ceremony**
  - Prevents casual or large-scale deployment
  - Encourages reflection and intent

- **Ephemeral messaging**
  - Reduces long-term data accumulation
  - Limits accidental harm from data retention

- **Human-verifiable security**
  - Avoids “black box” security theater
  - Empowers users to understand what is happening

- **Minimal backend trust**
  - Reduces central points of control or abuse

---

## What ASH will not do

The ASH project will not:

- add features designed to evade law enforcement
- provide instructions for illegal activity
- market itself as “untraceable” or “anonymous”
- optimize for scale, virality, or growth
- integrate surveillance evasion techniques
- accept funding that compromises these principles

If a requested feature meaningfully increases the risk of harm, it will not be implemented.

---

## Contributor expectations

Contributors (human or AI-assisted) are expected to:

- respect the documented scope and threat model
- consider ethical implications of changes
- avoid adding features that increase misuse potential
- raise concerns when ethical boundaries may be crossed

Ethical concerns are treated as **first-class design issues**, not afterthoughts.

---

## Limits of technology

ASH does not claim that technology alone can solve ethical problems.

- Tools can reduce harm, but not eliminate it
- Responsibility ultimately lies with people
- Transparency is more ethical than false guarantees

ASH prefers honest limits over misleading promises.

---

## Final statement

ASH exists to make **careful communication possible**, not effortless secrecy.

If at any point the project’s direction conflicts with this ethical position,  
the correct action is to **stop, reconsider, and possibly not proceed**.

Ethics are not a feature —  
they are a constraint.
