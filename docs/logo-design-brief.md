# ASH Logo Design Brief

## About ASH

ASH is a secure, ephemeral messaging application designed for high-security, low-frequency communication. The name "ASH" represents the ephemeral nature of messages - like ash, they exist briefly and then disappear without a trace.

### Core Principles
- **Absolute Privacy**: One-Time Pad encryption - mathematically unbreakable
- **Ephemeral by Design**: Messages are destroyed after reading, no recovery possible
- **Zero Trust**: Infrastructure cannot decrypt or access user data
- **Simplicity**: Complex security made accessible
- **European Values**: Privacy as a fundamental right, GDPR-compliant, EU-hosted

### Target Audience
- Security-conscious professionals
- Journalists and sources
- Privacy advocates
- Anyone needing truly private communication

## Brand Personality

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Trustworthy | Reliable, honest, no hidden agendas |
| Secure | Strong, protective, impenetrable |
| Minimal | Clean, focused, no unnecessary elements |
| Modern | Contemporary, forward-thinking |
| Ephemeral | Transient, fleeting, purposefully temporary |

## Logo Requirements

### Concept Direction

The logo should evoke:
- **Ephemerality**: The fleeting nature of ash, smoke, or dissipating particles
- **Security**: Protection, shields, locks (but not cliché)
- **Privacy**: Discretion, hidden, protected
- **Simplicity**: Clean lines, memorable at a glance

Possible visual metaphors:
- Ash particles dispersing
- A flame becoming ash
- Abstract "A" letterform
- Minimalist shield or protection symbol
- Negative space concepts

### What to Avoid
- Generic padlock or key icons
- Overly complex designs that don't scale
- Bright, playful colors (this is a serious security app)
- Chat bubble clichés
- Anything that looks like existing messaging apps (Signal, Telegram, WhatsApp)

### Color Palette

Primary direction: **Dark, muted, sophisticated**

Suggested palette:
- Primary: Deep charcoal/slate (#1a1a2e or similar)
- Accent: Warm ash gray or ember orange (subtle)
- Background: Near-black for dark mode prominence

The logo must work on:
- Dark backgrounds (primary use case)
- Light backgrounds
- Monochrome (single color)

### Technical Requirements

#### Formats Needed
- SVG (vector, scalable)
- PNG (transparent background, multiple sizes)
- PDF (print-ready)
- ICO/ICNS (favicons)

#### Sizes
| Use Case | Size |
|----------|------|
| iOS App Icon | 1024x1024px (will be scaled down) |
| Android App Icon | 512x512px (adaptive icon support) |
| Favicon | 16x16, 32x32, 48x48px |
| Social/Marketing | 800x800px |
| Website Header | Vector/SVG |

#### App Icon Specific
- Must be recognizable at 29x29px (iOS smallest)
- No text in app icon (won't be legible)
- Consider rounded corners (iOS) and adaptive icons (Android)
- Should stand out on home screen among other apps

### Logo Variations

Please provide:
1. **Primary Logo**: Icon + wordmark "ASH"
2. **Icon Only**: Standalone symbol (for app icons)
3. **Wordmark Only**: Stylized "ASH" text
4. **Monochrome**: Single color versions (black, white)
5. **Favicon**: Simplified version for small sizes

## Typography

If including wordmark:
- Sans-serif preferred (modern, clean)
- Consider: Inter, SF Pro, Helvetica Neue, custom letterforms
- All caps "ASH" or title case "Ash" - designer's discretion
- Letter spacing should convey security/stability

## Inspiration & References

### Mood
