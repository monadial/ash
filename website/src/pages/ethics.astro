      Ethics Statement

      Ethical position, intended uses, and design constraints
    </p>
  </header>

  <!-- Introduction -->
  <section>
    <p>
      ASH is a technical project, but it exists in a social and moral context.
      Strong privacy tools present an inherent dual-use challenge: the same
      properties that protect legitimate users can also shield harmful actors.
      This document describes our ethical position and the design decisions
      made in response to this challenge.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Intended Use Cases -->
  <section>
    <h2 id="intent" class="section-heading">1. Intended Use Cases</h2>

    <p>
      ASH is designed for situations where confidentiality is critical and
      trust in infrastructure is limited. The following use cases motivated
      the project's design:
    </p>

    <dl class="definition-list">
      <dt>Journalistic Source Protection</dt>
      <dd>
        Reporters communicating with sources who require confidentiality to
        avoid professional, legal, or personal consequences.
      </dd>

      <dt>Whistleblower Communication</dt>
      <dd>
        Individuals disclosing wrongdoing to trusted parties while minimizing
        the risk of identification or retaliation.
      </dd>

      <dt>Human Rights Work</dt>
      <dd>
        Activists, advocates, and documenters operating in environments where
        surveillance poses a threat to personal safety.
      </dd>

      <dt>Personal Safety</dt>
      <dd>
        Individuals in situations where secure communication is necessary for
        their physical or psychological well-being.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
      These use cases share common characteristics: communication is infrequent,
      parties can meet in person to establish trust, and the cost of compromise
      is high.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Acknowledgment of Misuse -->
  <section>
    <h2 id="misuse" class="section-heading">2. Acknowledgment of Misuse Potential</h2>

    <p>
      We acknowledge that any strong privacy tool can be misused. This risk is
      real and must be stated explicitly:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Coordination of criminal activity</li>
      <li>Harassment or abuse</li>
      <li>Concealment of harmful behavior</li>
      <li>Evasion of legitimate oversight</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      We do not claim that ASH prevents misuse. We do claim that ASH's design
      intentionally incorporates constraints that reduce certain categories of
      misuse while preserving utility for legitimate purposes.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Design Constraints -->
  <section>
    <h2 id="constraints" class="section-heading">3. Ethical Design Constraints</h2>

    <p>
      The following design decisions deliberately limit ASH's potential for
      harmful use:
    </p>

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Constraint</th>
          <th>Rationale</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>No network anonymity</td>
          <td>ASH does not hide that communication is occurring</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>One-to-one only</td>
          <td>No groups, channels, or broadcast capabilities</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Physical meeting required</td>
          <td>Cannot be used by parties who have never met</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>No automation</td>
          <td>Every action requires explicit user participation</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>No stealth modes</td>
          <td>ASH is visible when running; no hidden operation</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>No deniability claims</td>
          <td>We do not market or design for plausible deniability</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Finite capacity</td>
          <td>Fixed pad size limits total communication volume</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      ASH favors <em>deliberate, visible, human-driven interaction</em> over
      convenience or scale. This design philosophy reduces the tool's utility
      for mass coordination of harmful activities while preserving its value
      for the intended use cases.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Project Commitments -->
  <section>
    <h2 id="commitments" class="section-heading">4. Project Commitments</h2>

    <p>
      The ASH project commits to the following constraints:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>We will not add features designed to evade law enforcement</li>
      <li>We will not provide instructions for illegal activity</li>
      <li>We will not market the tool as "untraceable" or "anonymous"</li>
      <li>We will not optimize for scale, virality, or growth</li>
      <li>We will not integrate surveillance evasion techniques</li>
      <li>We will not accept funding that compromises these principles</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If a requested feature would meaningfully increase the risk of harm,
      it will not be implemented—regardless of its technical feasibility or
      user demand.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Responsibility Model -->
  <section>
    <h2 id="responsibility" class="section-heading">5. Responsibility Model</h2>

    <p>
      Ethical responsibility for ASH is distributed between project authors
      and users:
    </p>

    <h3 class="subsection-heading">5.1 Project Authors</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide honest, accurate documentation</li>
      <li>Make accurate security claims without exaggeration</li>
      <li>Clearly communicate limitations and non-guarantees</li>
      <li>Refuse features that increase potential for harm</li>
      <li>Respond appropriately to identified misuse patterns</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="subsection-heading">5.2 Users</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the tool lawfully and ethically</li>
      <li>Understand and accept the tool's limitations</li>
      <li>Take responsibility for their choice of conversation partners</li>
      <li>Not use ASH to facilitate harm to others</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      ASH cannot technically enforce user compliance with ethical guidelines.
      However, the design constraints described above reduce the tool's utility
      for large-scale or anonymous harmful activity.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Closing Statement -->
  <section>
    <h2 id="statement" class="section-heading">6. Closing Statement</h2>

    <blockquote>
      ASH exists to make careful communication possible, not effortless secrecy.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Ethics are not a feature—they are a constraint on what we will build.
      If at any point the project's direction conflicts with this ethical
      position, the correct action is to stop, reconsider, and possibly not
      proceed.
    </p>

    <p>
      We believe that privacy is a human right and that tools enabling private
      communication serve important social functions. We also believe that
      tool designers bear some responsibility for how their tools are used,
      and that this responsibility is best discharged through thoughtful
      design constraints rather than surveillance or backdoors.
    </p>

      This ethics statement is a living document. It may be updated as we
      learn more about how ASH is used and as social contexts evolve.
